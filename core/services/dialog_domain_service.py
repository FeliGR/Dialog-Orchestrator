Dialog Domain Service Module

This module implements the domain service for dialog-related business logic.
It provides a concrete implementation of the IDialogDomainService interface,
which composes a prompt for the language model by combining personality data
with the user's input.

Domain services encapsulate business rules that do not naturally belong
in the entity models themselves, keeping the core domain logic focused and clean.
